# Gravitation Lensing Visualization

Script visualizes the images created by a lensing object (such as a schwarzschild BH) of a distant source object (such as a galaxy). To execute the script, just run 
```shell
python Grav_Lensing.py
```


Feel free to add things to the script or message me for comments, questions, etc.
