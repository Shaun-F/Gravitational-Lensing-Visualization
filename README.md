# Gravitational Lensing Visualization

Script visualizes the images created by a lensing object (such as a schwarzschild BH) of a distant source object (such as a galaxy). To execute the script, just run 
```shell
python Grav_Lensing.py
```


Feel free to add things to the script or message me for comments, questions, etc.




# Gravitationally lensing images

Script takes an input image and calculates the lensing due to a schwarzschild black hole of mass 10^11 solar masses at 500 parsecs. Execute with
```shell
python Grav_Lensing_Image.py
```
Work in progress
